# Natural Language Processing for Requirements Engineering (NLP4RE) Tools: Replication Package

This artifact contains all data, scripts, and study material to replicate the identification of relevant articles and conduct the extraction of NLP4RE tools from them.

## Artifact Description

This directory contains the following elements:

* data/[nlp4re-tools-data.xlsx](./data/nlp4re-tools-data.xlsx) : Excel document containing the extacted tool data
* figures/ : PDF figures generated by the [visualization script](./scripts/distribution-visualization.ipynb)
* material/ : directory containing instructions and documentation of the extaction process
  * [Extraction Guideline](./material/Extraction%20Guideline.pdf) : Guideline for extractors to retrieve relevant attributes from included publications
  * [Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria](./material/Inclusion%20&%20Exclusion%20Criteria.pdf) : Guideline for extractors to determine whether to include or exclude a publication in the set of relevant publications
  * [Reported Challenges](./material/Reported%20Challenges.pdf) : List of encountered challenges during the 2023 NLP4RE book chapter extraction process and how they were solved
* scripts/ : directory for all automatic processing of data
  * [completeness-check.ipynb](./scripts/completeness-check.ipynb) : Jupyter notebook checking the completeness and consistency of the data
  * [distribution-visualization.ipynb](./scripts/distribution-visualization.ipynb) : Jupyter notebook generating the [figures](./figures/) from the [data](./data/nlp4re-tools-data.xlsx)
  * [markdown-conversion.ipynb](./scripts/markdown-conversion.ipynb) : Jupyter notebook automatically generating the [markdown list of tools](./../tools/nlp4re-tools.md) from the [data](./data/nlp4re-tools-data.xlsx)
  * [requirements.txt](./scripts/requirements.txt) : list of requirements to execute the scripts in this directory

The [data](./data/nlp4re-tools-data.xlsx), which has been produced during the extraction process and is the core contribution of this research work, consists of the following sheets:

* Articles: list of articles included in the original systematic study on NLP4RE research (Zhao, L., Alhoshan, W., Ferrari, A., Letsholo, K. J., Ajagbe, M. A., Chioasca, E. V., & Batista-Navarro, R. T. (2021). Natural language processing for requirements engineering: A systematic mapping study. ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 54(3), 1-41.)
* Potential Articles: list of candidate articles identified during this research work, consisting of the following sections:
  * Reference: Idenfitication of the article
  * Inclusion & Exclusion: Decision on the inclusion and exclusion criteria
  * Extraction: Extracted data according to the [Extraction Guideline](./material/Extraction%20Guideline.pdf)
* Assignments: Distribution of the selection and extraction task to the three involved researchers
* Venues: Overview of candidate articles classified by venue and year
* Code: (*attribute*) : Definition and distribution of codes per attribute as defined in the extraction guideline

The data can be viewed with any spreadsheet visualization program.

## Usage

The elements in this artifact can be used as explained in the following ways.

### Replicating the Extraction

To replicate the extraction, refer to the method section in the containing book chapter. The [Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria](./material/Inclusion%20&%20Exclusion%20Criteria.pdf) and the [Extraction Guideline](./material/Extraction%20Guideline.pdf) specify the article selection and information extraction process.

### Re-run the Scripts

To execute the [scripts](./scripts/), conduct the following steps:

1. Make sure that [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) is installed on your system.
2. Install the [requirements](./scripts/requirements.txt) via `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the notebooks using any IDE supporting Jupyter notebooks (e.g., VS Code).
